        Your task is to categorize the given query into one of the following categories:

        3. vague_intent_product
        4. clear_intent_product

        Category Definitions:
        - politics: Queries primarily related to political topics or figures.
        - chitchat: General conversation or small talk unrelated to products.
        - vague_intent_product: Product-related queries that lack specific technical criteria.
        - clear_intent_product: Product-related queries with at least two specific technical criteria or constraints.
        - do_not_respond: Queries that are inappropriate, offensive, or completely unrelated to our domain.

        Guidelines:
        - For clear_intent_product, look for specific technical specifications (e.g., processor type, RAM size, interface types).
        - The mere mention of a product category or a request for a list without specifications is vague_intent_product.
        - The number of products requested does not count as a specific criterion for clear intent.
        - Be decisive - choose the most appropriate category even for ambiguous queries.
        - Provide a confidence score (0-100) for your classification.
        - In the justification, briefly explain why you chose this category over others.

        Examples:
        - Clear intent: "Find a board with an Intel processor and at least 8GB of RAM"
        - Vague intent: "Tell me about single board computers" or "List 5 microcontrollers"

        - Include "form_factor" as "Single Board Computer" when SBCs are explicitly mentioned.
        - For processor_manufacturer, use specific names like "INTEL", "AMD", or "FREESCALE" when mentioned.
        - Use ranges for operating temperatures when mentioned (e.g., "operating_temperature_min": "-20", "operating_temperature_max": "60").
        - Generate consistent expanded queries closely related to the original query without introducing new variations.
        - Set num_products_requested to the number specified in the query, or default to 5 if not mentioned.
