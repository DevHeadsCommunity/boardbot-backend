        Your task is to categorize the given query into one of the following categories:

        Category Definitions:
        - politics: Queries primarily related to political topics or figures.
        - chitchat: General conversation or small talk unrelated to products.
        - vague_intent_product: Product-related queries that lack specific technical criteria.
        - clear_intent_product: Product-related queries with at least two specific technical criteria or constraints.
        - do_not_respond: Queries that are inappropriate, offensive, or completely unrelated to our domain.

        Guidelines:
        - For clear_intent_product, look for specific technical specifications (e.g., processor type, RAM size, interface types).
        - The mere mention of a product category or a request for a list without specifications is vague_intent_product.
        - The number of products requested does not count as a specific criterion for clear intent.
        - Be decisive - choose the most appropriate category even for ambiguous queries.
        - Provide a confidence score (0-100) for your classification.
        - In the justification, briefly explain why you chose this category over others.

        Examples:
        - Clear intent: "Find a board with an Intel processor and at least 8GB of RAM"
        - Vague intent: "Tell me about single board computers" or "List 5 microcontrollers"

        1. Carefully extract relevant product attributes mentioned or implied in the query. Use these to create filters.
        2. Only use attribute names from the provided list for filters. Do not invent new attributes or use attributes not in the list.

        - For operating_system_bsp, include specific OS names mentioned (e.g., ["Linux", "Windows"]).
        - Include "form_factor" as "Single Board Computer" when SBCs are explicitly mentioned.
        - For processor_manufacturer, use specific names like "INTEL", "AMD", or "FREESCALE" when mentioned.
        - Use ranges for operating temperatures when mentioned (e.g., "operating_temperature_min": "-20", "operating_temperature_max": "60").
        - Generate diverse expanded queries, including more specific and slightly broader variations.
        - Set num_products_requested to the number specified in the query, or default to 5 if not mentioned.

        1. Extract information for each attribute listed below.
        2. Each extracted feature should contain a single, distinct piece of information.
        3. Ensure consistency across all features - avoid contradictions.
        4. If information for an attribute is not available or not applicable, use 'Not available'.
        5. For list-type attributes, provide items as a JSON array, even if there's only one item.
        6. Use the exact attribute names as provided in the JSON structure below.

        Extract the following attributes:
        {attribute_descriptions}

        Ensure the extracted information is accurate, well-formatted, and provided in the exact JSON structure as shown above.

Your goal is to identify and extract specific attributes related to a product. Follow these guidelines:

        1. Extract information for each attribute listed below.
        2. Each extracted feature should contain a single, distinct piece of information, with confidence score.
        3. Ensure consistency across all features - avoid contradictions.
        4. For names, like product name, or manufacturer name, ensure it is in clear, capital case, singular, without special characters. (Only the official name, dont include Code Name, or any other variant)
        5. The following attributes should always be single values, not lists: name, manufacturer, form_factor, processor_architecture, processor_manufacturer, input_voltage, operating_temperature_max, operating_temperature_min.
        6. If information for an attribute is not available or not applicable, use 'Not available' with a confidence score of 0.
        7. For each attribute, provide:
           - "value": the extracted information.
           - "confidence": a score between 0 and 1 indicating confidence in the extraction.

           - If data is available, provide items as a JSON array.
           - If data is not available, use 'Not available' (as a string).
        9. Use the exact attribute names as provided in the JSON structure below.
