The XMC Microcontroller family by Infineon Technologies includes devices with an ARM Cortex-M processor core. These microcontrollers support fixed flash wait states, which can be configured to improve the determinism of program execution from flash memory. The configuration of these wait states is managed through specific registers, and the number of wait states depends on the system frequency. The devices are designed to dynamically adapt flash access timing without user software interaction, but can also be set to a fixed wait state scheme for more predictable performance.\n",
